This document describes how to make quick edits to the content
packages used by The Ur-Quan Masters.

1. Extract the package
----------------------
The content is distributed in `.uqm` archives. These are ordinary ZIP
files. Use `unzip` to extract them:

    unzip uqm-0.8.0-content.uqm -d tmp

This creates a directory `tmp` with the package contents.

2. Modify the files
-------------------
Edit the extracted files as needed. For example, you might change text
in `base/gamestrings.txt`.

3. Repack the archive
---------------------
When your changes are complete, recreate the archive with `zip`:

    cd tmp
    zip -r ../uqm-0.8.0-content.uqm .

Copy the resulting `uqm-0.8.0-content.uqm` back to
`content/packages/` so the game can use your modified content.
